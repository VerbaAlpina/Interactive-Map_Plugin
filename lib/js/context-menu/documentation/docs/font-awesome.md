## Customize icons

It is possible to use font-awesome icons if you like. You need to include the [Font Awesome CSS](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/) in your application. That will enable you to use the icon classes to use those icons.

### Example

```javascript
var items = {
    firstCommand: {        
        name: "Paste",
        icon: "fa-trash" // Font-awesome trash icon
    }
}
```

## Bring your own icons

It is also possible to use your own SVG icons if you like, you can [customize](customize) this by using the SASS files.
